- **Input System integration** (no legacy Input usage)
- **Automatic integration** with existing game systems

## Input System

The project uses Unity's Input System with comprehensive input action mappings configured in `Assets/Settings/Input/InputSystem_Actions.inputactions`:

### Player Actions
- **Move**: WASD/Arrow keys, gamepad left stick, touch gestures
- **Look**: Mouse delta, gamepad right stick
- **Attack**: Mouse left click, gamepad X button, touch tap, Enter key
- **Interact**: E key, gamepad Y button (hold interaction)
- **Crouch**: C key, gamepad B button

- **Sprint**: Left Shift, gamepad left stick press
- **Previous/Next**: Number keys 1/2, gamepad D-pad

### UI Actions
- **F1**: Toggle debug panel
- **ESC**: Close top UI panel
- Standard UI navigation with support for all input methods (keyboard, gamepad, touch, XR)

**Important**: The project uses the NEW Input System exclusively. All UI scripts use `UnityEngine.InputSystem` instead of legacy `UnityEngine.Input`.

## Architecture Notes

This Unity project is configured for 2D isometric game development with:
- Universal Render Pipeline for optimized 2D rendering
- Component-based architecture with modular systems
- ScriptableObject-based configuration system (LevelConfiguration, FishDatabase)
- Modern UI Toolkit for performant, maintainable UI
- Comprehensive input system supporting multiple platforms
- Event-driven architecture for system communication
- 2D-focused package selection (animation, sprites, tilemaps)
- Multi-platform input scheme (desktop, mobile, gamepad, XR ready)
- Organized code structure following Unity best practices

## Game Systems Integration

### Core System Workflow
1. **GameManager**: Central coordination point, initializes all systems
2. **UIIntegrationManager**: Connects UI Toolkit with game systems
3. **Event-driven updates**: Systems communicate through events (OnFishAdded, OnTimeChanged, etc.)
4. **Automatic UI updates**: Data binding ensures UI reflects game state changes

### Key Integration Points
- **FishingController** ↔ **GameHUD**: Real-time fishing UI updates
- **InventorySystem** ↔ **NotificationManager**: Fish catch notifications
- **GameTimeManager** ↔ **UI displays**: Time/day progression
- **Debug systems** ↔ **All game systems**: Comprehensive monitoring and control

## File Conventions

- C# scripts should be placed in `Assets/Scripts/` with appropriate subdirectories
- UI Toolkit files go in `Assets/UI/` (UXML, USS, Scripts)
- Scene files go in `Assets/Scenes/`
- Use Unity's standard naming conventions (PascalCase for classes, camelCase for variables)
- Follow Unity's component-based architecture patterns
- UI components inherit from UIToolkitPanel base class
- Use UIManager.Instance for centralized UI management

## Development Best Practices

### UI Development
- Use UI Toolkit instead of Canvas-based UI for new interfaces
- Leverage data binding for reactive UI updates
- Follow the established USS styling patterns
- Use the debug panel (F1) for testing and development
- Refer to `Assets/UI/SETUP_GUIDE.md` for detailed UI documentation

### Input Handling
- Always use UnityEngine.InputSystem, never legacy Input
- Input actions are configured in InputSystem_Actions.inputactions
- UI scripts handle input through Input System events

### System Integration
- Use events for loose coupling between systems
- Register UI panels with UIManager for centralized control
- Follow the established naming conventions for UI elements
- Leverage the NotificationManager for user feedback

### Documentation
- **IMPORTANT**: When adding or updating game systems, create or update documentation in the `Docs/` folder
- Each major system should have a comprehensive markdown guide covering:
  - System overview and architecture
  - Prerequisites and dependencies
  - Step-by-step setup instructions
  - Configuration options and best practices
  - Testing procedures
  - Troubleshooting common issues
  - Code examples and API references
- Existing guides:
  - `Docs/FISHING_ZONES_GUIDE.md` - Complete fishing system and water zone setup
  - `Docs/TERRAIN_GENERATION_GUIDE.md` - Procedural terrain generation system

- **System Tab**: Performance metrics, memory usage, FPS monitoring
- **Game State Tab**: Time controls, player info, inventory management
- **Fishing Tab**: Water zones, fish database, catch rate debugging
- **Terrain Tab**: Live terrain generation with parameter controls
- **Cheats Tab**: Developer tools (add fish, teleport, system toggles)

### UI Development
- **UI Builder**: Visual UXML editing
- **UI Debugger**: Runtime UI inspection
